test.html and test2.html and test4.html are just meant to be read so that you can see the changes made; they can be read with vim. test3.html is the output from one of my answers, but is not that important. 

qtest.txt actually runs a script for question 2 

current_test3.txt contains the list of files to be moved into the new directory. It looks a bit weird because i wrote it in vim and downloaded it to windows. But if you wanted to change it so that it has new paragraphs and such, the code will still work.
